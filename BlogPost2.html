			<p>So, you want to know about == vs just = eh? Well, you've come to the
			right place. We're all very impressed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Both == and = are equals signs. Right? So what's the difference? Well, if 
			you'd let me explain before asking so many questions, maybe I'll tell you!
			</p>
			<p>
			= (just one equals sign, that is) is used to define a variable. Whether 
			an integer, a double, a string...whatever really. Define it by typing
			the variable (once it's been initialized, although you can define and
			initialize all at once) followed by the equals sign '=' (just one!)
			and the value to which you want to set that variable.
			</p>
			<p>
			== (two equals signs of this time!) is used in equations. Want to check
			if something is actually equal to something else? For instance does x + x
			equal 4? Then use 2 equals signs! One will simply not do the trick!
