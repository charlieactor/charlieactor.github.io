		<h3>Void Method Declaration</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="body">
			<p>Sick of typing "void" into all of your "public static ____" methods?
			Come on, it's literally 4 letters. Seriously? Alright fine, fine I'll
			tell you WHY you have to type it, since you insist on knowing EVERYTHING.
			</p>
			<p>
			That void there, that little friendly "void" that you seem to loathe so odiously,
			is merely telling java that this program doesn't return a value. That's it.
			</p>
			<p>
			So, say you're writing a function and you don't want it to return a value.
			Great! Type void in there, and you're done! But, say you're writing a function 
			and you DO want it to return a value. If you want an integer, throw a lil' "int"
			in there where the void would usually go. Maybe a double? Hell, throw a bit 
			of "double" in! Why not a string? That's always an option, too.
			</p>
			<p>
			Give it a try why don't ya! Whatever you write in the method declaration, 
			java will expect that method/funtion to return a value of that type, be it
			a string, an integer, a double, or nothing at all!
