		<h3>Casting a Double to an Int</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="body">
			<p>Trying to cast a double to an Int are we? Yeah, I thought you might.
			You just seem like the type. You know, the type that hates decimals?
			Always hating on fractions? Never been fond of things that come in thirds
			because you know they never end and you don't see how 3/3 could possibly
			equal one?
			</p>
			<p>
			Well, let me tell you what casting a double to an integer does. It just lops
			off the decimal. Lops it right off, you callous son of a bitch. The thing is,
			it'll lop off even .99999 repeating (which is essentially 1) and make it a 0! 
			</p>
			<p>
			Madness you say? Maybe, but maybe not. Sometimes it's nice to be able to just
			work with whole numbers. Like with the Math.random() operation for instance.
			It gives you a random number between 0 and 0.999. If you cast that to an
			integer, it'll give you 0! But if you add 1, and multiply the whole thing by
			X, it'll give you a random number between 1 and X. Pretty swell eh?
			</p>
			<p>
			It is pretty swell. Casting doubles to integers can help simplify things
			substantially, so long as you're not worried about getting too exact (which
			you're clearly not, look at you, you decimal hating anti-decimalite!!!).
