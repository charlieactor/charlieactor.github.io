		<h3>Switch vs. If/Else</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="body">
			<p>If/else clauses and Switch can be used for similar situations in Java.
			Sometimes it will make more sense to use Switch, other times to use if/else 
			(though they can be used fairly interchangeably). 
			</p>
			<p>
			Both are used to define a condition. If that condition is true, the 
			subsequent code block will run. If not, it will skip that code and go on to
			the next block of code. 
			</p>
			<p>
			It would make more sense to use switch if many possible outcomes will
			use the same code block. For instance, in Java the Hard Way, you program
			a days in the month calculator. For this, 5 months have 30 days, 1 month 
			has 28 days, and the rest have 31 days.
			</p>
			<p>
			If coding this using if/else clauses, we'd have to write the same code
			many times. However, with Switch, we can say: For cases 4, 6, 9, and 11:
			print out "30 days". For case 2, print out "28 days". Default: "31 days".
			This saves many lines of code! Yay switch!
