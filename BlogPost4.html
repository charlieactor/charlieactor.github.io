		<h3>Importing java.util.Scanner</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="body">
			<p>Wondering why you keep typing in import java.util.Scanner? You just
			have to question everything, don't you?!
			</p>
			<p>
			Fine, fine, simmer down already and I'll tell you. 
			</p>
			<p>
			When you type in your 4 favorite words, import java.util.Scanner, you're
			telling java to import the Scanner utility in the java library. You see,
			some nice soul was kind enough to type out the software to understand
			what somebody is typing into the keyboard, so YOU don't have to!
			</p>
			<p>
			Now couldn't you stop complaining and just try to be grateful for once!?
			Sheesh!
